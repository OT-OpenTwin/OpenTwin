## What is OpenTwin?

**OpenTwin** is an open-source platform that supports the development and operation of **Digital Twins** for product development.  

Its architecture is based on **microservices**, which are independently deployable, loosely coupled components (services) that communicate through lightweight protocols.  
This design makes OpenTwin **flexible**, **scalable**, and well-suited for integrating heterogeneous tools into digital twin workflows.

The motivation for OpenTwin arises from pressing industrial challenges in **multi-domain** and **multiscale applications** including:

- Structural mechanics  
- Electromagnetics  
- Thermodynamics  
- Fluid dynamics  
- Material science  

where accurate and scalable digital twin solutions are increasingly required.  
At present, OpenTwin supports the execution of individual, high-performance physical simulations.

## Why OpenTwin?

Existing commercial digital twin solutions are often **closed systems**, which makes the integration of custom components and extensions difficult.  
In contrast, many academic or in-house solutions lack the robustness and infrastructure required for industrial applications.  

While a wide range of open-source tools exists for individual tasks, they typically do not address two central challenges:

1. **Platform integration** ‚Äì OpenTwin provides a **microservice-based framework** for integrating heterogeneous tools into a distributed platform.  
2. **Lifecycle management** ‚Äì OpenTwin implements **built-in dataset versioning** and **data management**, enabling consistent tracking, undo/redo functionality, and branching.  

By combining established open-source technologies within a unified architecture, OpenTwin bridges the gap between **flexibility**, **extensibility**, and **industrial applicability**.
