Application Exit Codes
######################

Any exit code that is generated by OpenTwin itself (excluding ThirdParty components) is listed `in the "OTSystem/AppExitCodes.h" file. <../_static/codedochtml/classot_1_1_app_exit_code.xhtml>`_
Exit codes must always remain unique and changing the values of existing exit codes should be avoided as much as possible.

Exit codes generated by the Framework are listed in the `FrameworkExitCode enum <../_static/codedochtml/classot_1_1_app_exit_code.xhtml>`_ .
