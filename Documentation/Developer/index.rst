Welcome
=======

OpenTwin is a microservices based open source platform for supporting multiphysical multiscale simulations. 

The data storage adopts a MongoDB data base driven approach where data lifecycle management is fundamentally supported by the data model. 
Communication between the services is based on HTTP with (m)TLS security. The software relies on a large number of powerful third party libraries.
