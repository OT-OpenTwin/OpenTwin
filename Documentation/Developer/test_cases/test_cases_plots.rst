==========================

Single Curve

   * - 1
     - Create a developer project.
     - Select the button **"Single Curve"** in the Debug Tab.
     - A plot is created in the Test folder. The plot looks like the reference image. Check especially:
        - Units are set
        - Plot name matches the entity name of the plot entity
        - Curve label matches the curve entity's name
       

   * - 1.1
     - 
     - Change curve properties (line style, thickness, colour).
     - Curve updates with new settings. Process should be quick (UI should not re-query data).

   * - 1.2
     - 
     - Close and reopen the plot view.
     - Updated curve properties persist.

   * - 1.3
     - 
     - Rename the curve entity.
     - Curve title updates to the new entity name.

   * - 1.4
     - 
     - Rename the plot entity.
     - Plot title updates to the new entity name.

   * - 1.5
     - 
     - In plot properties:
         - Set "Number of queries" to 1
         - Define query 1:
             - Name: `Magnitude`
             - Comparator: `<` 
             - Value: `30`
     - Curve is not plotted for values â‰¥ 30. Zooming out confirms data are truly filtered, not just zoomed.

   * - 1.6
     - 
     - In plot properties:
         - Set "Number of queries" to 2
         - Define query 2:
             - Name: `frequency`
             - Comparator: `Range`
             - Value: `[10, 20]`
     - Only frequencies from 10 to 20 are plotted.

   * - 1.7
     - 
     - Disable `Autoscale` in Y axis group. Set min = 10, max = 15.
     - Only the section of the curve from 10 to 15 is shown.

   * - 2.2
     - 
     - Select the entity `A_Curve2`.  
     - `A_Curve2` is shown in its selected colour; `A_Curve1` is grayed out.
